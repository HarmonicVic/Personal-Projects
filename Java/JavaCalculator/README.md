Basic calculator.

It currently runs on the command line. I have made it interactive to a certain extent, such that it tells you what to input, and when there's an error with your input. It currently accepts two numbers and a sign corresponding to the desired calculation function.
The calculator's current functions (and signs) are:

  -Sum (+)
  
  -Subtract (-)
  
  -Multiply (\*)
  
  -Divide (/)
  
  -Power (^)
  
  -Square root (v)
  
  The current version has a very basic memory variable to access the previous result (ANS), and it can be accessed during calculations.
